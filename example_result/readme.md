## Example files

In this directory you can see what one can achieve in couple of minutes: 
1. I asked chat GPT for the input file
2. I used first script to generate assets
3. I copied the second script into the assets\yacg\textures\block in the resourcepack directory
4. I used the secondary script, and deleted it after it finished
5. I copied output to my instance directory
6. Screenshot "many generators with their own textures done in 10 minutes tops.png" is the result
